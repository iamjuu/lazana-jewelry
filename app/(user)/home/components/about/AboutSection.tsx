                  Crystal Bowl Studio was founded by Francesca Wong, a former
                  corporate executive with experience at KPMG, Citibank, Alibaba,
                  and Estée Lauder. After over a decade in global finance,
                  ecommerce, and luxury beauty, she journeyed from boardrooms to a
                  vision: "To create a range of crystal singing bowls that honour
                  beauty, premium crystal quality and sound, with powerful
                  resonance, at a more affordable price." Her mission is to make the
                  power of Sound Healing accessible to healers and practitioners all
                  over the world, anywhere anytime. Crystal Bowl Studio was born
                  from the belief that healing tools should be well-crafted,
                  intentional, and accessible. Objects that support presence,
                  ritual, and connection in everyday life. Each bowl is designed not
                  only to aesthetically sound exquisite, but to feel purposeful in
                  the hands of the person using it. This work is an offering to
                  practitioners, teachers, and seekers around the world, who wish to
                  experience and share the power of sound healing with ease,
                  simplicity, beauty, and integrity.
